# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Modern Blog System and provides guidance for secure deployment and maintenance.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token generation
- **Account lockout** after 5 failed login attempts (15-minute lockout)
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints (5 requests/15 minutes)
- **Session management** with token blacklisting on logout
- **IP tracking** for suspicious activity detection

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **HTML sanitization** using DOMPurify for all user content
- **Input validation** using express-validator
- **XSS protection** through Content Security Policy
- **SQL injection prevention** via parameterized queries

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** with strict directives
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** for HTTPS enforcement
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME sniffing
- **Referrer Policy** set to no-referrer

### Data Protection
- **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **bcrypt password hashing** with salt rounds
- **Secure cookie settings** (when implemented)
- **CORS configuration** with whitelisted origins

## üö® Critical Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with secure values:

```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))")

# Set strong admin credentials
ADMIN_USER=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASS=your-strong-password

# Configure email securely
EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Production settings
NODE_ENV=production
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Database Security
- Ensure database file permissions are restricted (600)
- Regular backups with encryption
- Consider using PostgreSQL for production instead of SQLite

### 3. Server Configuration
- Use HTTPS in production (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers
- Enable fail2ban for additional brute force protection

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - Use `.env` files for configuration
   - Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables in CI/CD

2. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server
   - Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists
   - Sanitize HTML content before storage and display

3. **Error handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events for monitoring
   - Use generic error messages for authentication failures

4. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies (`npm audit`)
   - Use exact versions in production
   - Monitor security advisories

### For Deployment

1. **Server hardening**
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Use non-root user for application
   - Set up proper file permissions
   - Configure log rotation

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up intrusion detection
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Alert on suspicious patterns
   - Regular security scans

3. **Backup strategy**
   - Encrypted database backups
   - Secure backup storage
   - Test restore procedures
   - Document recovery process

## üîç Vulnerability Assessment

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ Removed exposed credentials from repository
- ‚úÖ Implemented HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
- ‚úÖ Strengthened Content Security Policy
- ‚úÖ Added secure session management with token revocation
- ‚úÖ Enhanced input validation across all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling to prevent information leakage

### Remaining Considerations
- Consider implementing CSRF tokens for form submissions
- Add request signing for sensitive operations
- Implement progressive security measures (2FA, etc.)
- Consider using Redis for token blacklist in production
- Add automated security testing to CI/CD pipeline

## üìù Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Generate and set strong JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Configure HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable security headers on reverse proxy
- [ ] Configure rate limiting at proxy level
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Create incident response plan
- [ ] Schedule regular security updates
- [ ] Perform penetration testing
- [ ] Document security procedures

## üö® Incident Response

### If security breach is detected:

1. **Immediate actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess scope of breach
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs for entry point
   - Identify compromised data
   - Document timeline
   - Determine root cause

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Reset compromised credentials
   - Revoke affected tokens
   - Restore from clean backups if needed

4. **Post-incident**
   - Update security measures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Document lessons learned
   - Review and update procedures

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential.
